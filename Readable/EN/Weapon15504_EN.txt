In his sweet dream, the dragon king saw again the little comrades it once followed.
"If we ride on your back and cross these mountains, we can reach the palace on the moon, right?"
This is the dragon king's dream, a dream of the past that he dreams in his subterranean slumber.

Sometimes, when he is awoken from this dream by pain, he remembers,
Remembers the words he said, the day he turned on that man, rendering their paths contrary:
"Just as I have brought peace to the land alongside you all,"
"So too shall I cause the mountains to split open like dragon-teeth,"
