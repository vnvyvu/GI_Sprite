 
They say that,
Once upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from the heavens directly.
The envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then, when the distant thunders ceased, and the mighty winds arose.

People enjoyed prosperity, but feared that its end would come.
With the magnificence of prosperity came seeds of wisdom and the freedom to think,
And wisdom and thought brought endless doubt and fear.

So the people of the land tried to reach the heavens,
For if they could but glimpse the island in the sky,
They would perhaps no longer doubt that the promised land the envoys sang of existed...

So the white-crowned chief priest, even as his fellows marched towards the heavens,
Walked alone into the deep places of the world.
He found there a warning, deep within the long-forgotten ruins and altars.
But this time, no one would welcome the answer he brought back.
