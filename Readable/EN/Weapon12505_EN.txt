 
In the early years of Liyue, the ocean was still the domain of wicked gods and great monsters.
Our ancestors set sail and sallied forth to do battle against a great sea monster, but few ever returned.

It was named "Baqiu" by the people of Liyue â€” the uncrowned lord of the watery depths.
As the storms breathed upon the surface of the sea (or perhaps it was the creature's own breath that brought the storms)
The tides would shatter dock and harbor as if they were but salt and sand,
And the waves would splinter boats like fragile Glaze Lilies.

Thus did Rex Lapis summon forth lengths of impregnable jade,
Some shaped like tide-devouring whales,
And others like soaring falcons,

When the jade leviathans were first forged, they brought fear and alarm to the oceanic titans, who trembled at the sight of them,
As they used impregnable nephrite for fangs and contended fiercely with them,
While the great birds of prey became spears that pinned the roaring beasts down within the dark, bottomless seas.
The whales forged of rock would in the end gain their freedom, returning to the distant mountains from whence they came.

As to the conclusion of this tale, the storytellers of the harbor city will say:
Today, the great whales of crystallized jade still swim free amid the cloud-shrouded adepti abodes,
And they leap and toss within the ocean of mists, singing their great whale-chorus amid the silence of the countless mountains.
But if the ocean were to ever again rise to threaten the land, they will once again rain down upon the dark waters like stone spears...
